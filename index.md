# Second Milestone

My second milestone was implementing a Godot emulator to the RetroPie system. First I needed to get Wifi which I went through many solutions and yet still they didn't work. For example, I thought the problem was that the Raspberry Pi could only connect to a 2.4 ghz Wifi network, but even that didn't work. In the end, I just chose to go with an ethernet cable. After that I cloned the github with all the Godot emulator code into my RetroPie and tranferred a default game from Godot to the RetroPie.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was getting the base project working. For seting up the Raspberry Pi, I added components like heatsinks and set up the SD card. Then I downloaded RetroPie, as apposed to Raspberry Pi OS since this is an emulator project. After downloading a Rasberry Pi Imager, I wrote the RetroPie software to the Raspberry Pi. Then I connected the Raspberry Pi to the monitor and plugged in all the power cords. After that, I booted up the system and connected my keyboard to the Raspberry Pi and then configured all the setting on the RetroPie to set up the emulator system (i.e. Raspi-Config, Audio, etc). After that I downloaded and transferred a ROM file from my computer to the RetroPie.
